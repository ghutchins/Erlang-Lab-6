CSC 231 Lab 6 - Intermediate Erlang, Part 1 Additional Test Cases
Georgina Hutchins


1. Added 1 additional test case with an odd numbered list of length > 1 to ensure the 
	pairs properly multiply and then go into proper base case and return the single element
	correctly


2.
	a) Don't need to add any additional tests. Tester file handles having either list1 or list2
		empty and testing two lists with different numbers of coefficients.
		The only additional test that might be needed is handling two empty lists--but nothing
		necessarily needs to return in that case.

	b) Add test file for base case that has an empty list for input. delete(X,[]). Tester file
		handles problems that arise when second list is longer than the first, or when one
		list is empty and the other is not

	c) Need to add 2 tests. polyeval([2,0,4],0) --> X == 0, only return the head of list (Y).
				polyeval([],7) --> empty list with any input value, returns 0. 

3.
	a) Add test for empty set. member(4,[]) --> Return false.
		Tester file handles cases in which value X is in the set, and when it is not.

	b) Add test for empty set. delete(2,[]) --> Returns empty list. 
		Tester file handles cases in which value to be deleted is not in the list, and
		when it is in the list and is successfully deleted.

	c) Add test for inserting into the empty set. insert(9,[]) --> Returns the list with
		only 1 value (9 just inserted).

4.Don't need to add any additional tests since the tester file has a case with 1, 2, and 3 values
	in the list. The base case is handled dealing with lists of lenth 1 and 2, and the list with
	3 values successfully returns after going through the recursive case.

5. Add test case with a list that has repeating numbers to ensure the repeated digits are
	still placed in the correct position in descending order. selectionSort([3,7,7,4,1]).

6.
	a) Don't need additional test.Tester file has cases with negative and positive values in
		the list. Function does not handle empty input, so nothing returns if the list
		is empty -- don't need to add.

	b) Don't need additional tests. Tester file has tests for empty list, list with one short 
		input, and two cases with input that contains strings of length >4 and >=4.
